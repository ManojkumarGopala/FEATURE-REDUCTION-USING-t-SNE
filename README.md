# FEATURE-REDUCTION-USING-t-SNE
Machine Learning Algorithms
Due to the recent surge in data, handling of such huge amount of data has placed large number of
challenges. The data that is recorded has reached deeper level of granularity increasing the dimensions to
be handled. Dimensionality reduction is process of using lesser number of dimensions without losing much
information. It facilitates reduction in storage space and helps in data compression. It also helps reduce the
computation time that raises steeply for a dataset with higher dimensionalities. Another important use of
Dimensionality reduction is in visualization of data. Data Analysis provides important insights into the data
to take important decisions about the businesses. Visualization of data with higher dimensions quite is not
clear and does not help in decision making.
For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, the project shows how t-SNE can use random walks on
neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset
of the data is displayed.The project illustrates the performance of t-SNE on two large datasets with variety of
features and compare it with conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, like PCA. The results
produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on both of the
datasets.
